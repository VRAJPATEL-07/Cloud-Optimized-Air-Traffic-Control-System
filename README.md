## 🚀 Project Overview

This system simulates a cloud-native Air Traffic Control (ATC) solution to:

- Monitor and manage real-time flight data across multiple airports.
- Predict airspace congestion and dynamically reroute flights.
- Handle system failures gracefully using cloud redundancy.
- Utilize scalable and distributed messaging for efficient data flow.
